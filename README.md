`billstclair/elm-crypto-string` does block chaining and string conversion for encrypting strings. It is designed to plug in to any low-level, block-based encryption module that can be made to follow its protocol. It ships knowing how to talk to [`billstclair/elm-crypto-aes`](http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/billstclair/elm-crypto-aes/latest), a pure Elm rendering of the Advanced Encryption Standard.
